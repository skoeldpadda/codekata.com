#Kata 02: Karate Chop

##Goals:
* Encountered errors
* Merits: which one will make it into production? fun of writing? hardest to get working?
* how did you come up with approaches four and five?

##Technique 1: iterative approach
###Notes
* many cases to consider and to explicitly solve
* code duplication, eg for first loop iteration
* hard to write: a clean, readable solution is not obvious
* handling the current search window is nasty and a possible source of errors

###Encountered errors
1. infinite loop: typo (two distinct variable names by accident)
2. errenous handling of current search window
3. (was able to remove duplicate check for a special case)
